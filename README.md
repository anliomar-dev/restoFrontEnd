## Design Inspiration
The visual design of this project, including the color scheme and layout, was inspired by a Bootstrap template. 
However, no code from the template was used, only the aesthetic elements influenced the design choices.

## Backend API
For the configuration of the backend API, please refer to the README of the [API repository](https://github.com/yourusername/api-repo) for detailed instructions.

## Consuming the API
You can create your own frontend to consume the API and display dishes. The API is available at [https://omaranli.alwaysdata.net/](https://omaranli.alwaysdata.net/) and allows you to:
- Fetch dishes and restaurant data.
- Display the available dishes in a user-friendly interface.

## Contributing to the API
If you want to contribute to the backend, you can help improve the API by adding features like:
- Allowing users to create an account and log in.
- Enabling users to create a restaurant and add dishes specifically related to that restaurant.
- Allowing users to display their own dishes in their personalized interface.

For detailed instructions on how to contribute to the API, please refer to the [API repository](https://github.com/yourusername/api-repo).
